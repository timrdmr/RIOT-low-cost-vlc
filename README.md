# Low-cost IP over Visible Light Communication System for the IoT 

This project was developed in the scope of a bachelor's thesis.
It provides a physical and link layer implemenation for a low-cost Visible LIght Communication (VLC) system uing the RIOT OS.
RIOT provides the upper network stack with e.g. IPv6 and UDP.
Here you can find the code as well as documentation on how to use this VLC implementation together with RIOT.
More details e.g. about the requiered hardware, limitatons and examples will follow soon.
